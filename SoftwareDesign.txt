Software design is the process of defining a given problem and then how to solve that problem using software. 
This includes the logical breaking-up of the problem into its smallest chunks, and how these chunks interact with each other. 
Specifically, the chunks are the job of the software developer, but how the chunks interact with one another are the responsibility of the software designer.
It is also the formal language of "what" each component of a software system does, and how it interacts with other components, but now the "how" of the component.
